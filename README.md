# Flight-Management-System

Flight Seat Booking System uses client server architecture and passes message using socket programming. It is used simulate reserving a seat in a flight. When 2 or more people try to book a same seat at the same time, there might be some synchronization issues. So, we use multithreading and synchronization so that data is synchronized. This project aims at maintaining all the information pertaining to the traveler and book a seat based on seat availability. It also reduces lot of paperwork which is a main part of the manual system.
